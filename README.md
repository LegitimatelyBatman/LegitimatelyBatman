## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm currently working on a GAN project!
- Currently trying to learn more about DL and ML as a whole
- I'm looking for help with some website programming stuff for another project down the line
- I'm more of a hobbyist than a professional CS developer, so excuse the poor coding techniques
